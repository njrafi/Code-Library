A lattice point in the plane is any point that has integer coordinates.

Let P be a polygon in the plane whose vertices have integer coordinates.
Then the area of P can be determined just by counting the lattice points on the interior and boundary of the polygon!

In fact, the area is given by

Area(P) = i + (b/2) - 1

where i is the number interior lattice points, and b is the number of boundary lattice points
